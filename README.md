# Virtual keyboard
A really cool glowing on screen keyboard 
This keyboard is made responsive for use on both pc and mobile phones not less than 260px.
I currently do not have everything put in place for proper use and you are welcome to make your own cotributions to this projects.
What this project needs now is the javascript functions to make the different functional keys work like they are supposed to.
For example the Delete key.
